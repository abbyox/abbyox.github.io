title:  "When I Grow Up"

On the very last page of my fifth grade yearbook is a collage of me and all of my classmates with a simple "What do you want to be when you grow up?" title at the top. Under each student picture is a myriad of typical fifth grade child responses; doctor, scientist, lead singer in a band, professional hockey player. And then there was me. I've always had a tough time committing to things - especially things written in yearbooks. What if I change my mind next year? What if some cool new profession pops up that I wasn't aware of? In a flurry of likely being overwhelmed with such a profound statement, I choked up and wrote the first thing that came to mind: *A High School Physics Teacher.* 

What? 

I am 99.9% sure I had no idea what a physics teacher even did at that point, but it sounded different and (I guess?) interesting so I wrote it and probably threw the pen down like a major mic drop and walked out of the classroom to run laps around the playground (I had a lot of energy). 

My point here is that I've never really had a clear "career" path and, at almost age 30, I still have a hard time committing to this "what are you going to do with your life" inquiry. In college, I teetered with physical therapy to computer science to speech writing to advertising, eventually settling on Marketing and Journalism which have led me to my current lifestyle of working remotely and picking up clients through word of mouth and random craigslist-esque sites. Instead of committing to something, I took what I liked and made it my own. 

Programming has been on my mind since I was first introduced to HTML while editing content on a website for my first (real) job out of college. My understanding was (is) very basic, but I found that it came pretty naturally and I was actually coding email templates from scratch without realizing what I was doing. So after years of outsourcing work that I am so sure I could do, I am here to make myself that much more marketable and to continue to live a transient lifestyle. I thrive on living my life on my terms and I plan to encourage others (especially other women) to pursue a life of travel and self reliance.
