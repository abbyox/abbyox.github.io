As I'm writing this, my homepage is telling me I'm three hours past my due date. Classssssic!

Honestly, I'm struggling to keep up with my Flatiron timeline due to an inordinate amount of real-world work. The amazing thing, however, is that I've just started the HTML portion of the program as I am in the middle of migrating two (actually three total) websites to shiny new templates that are mobile optimized. 

At the start of this program, I was so motivated and excited. As the days passed and labs became harder and more obscure, I started to lose steam. This program is not easy to do online. It is a lot of self-motivation and determination to basically figure things out that you've never even heard of. As I finished the Intro to Ruby portion, I started to realize that I didin't know sh--t about GitHub. I still don't. But the more I use it and the more I look into articles about programming language (a key to understanding some of this stuff, by the way) I've learned more and more how useful this platform is. 

Back to programming - Ruby is an interesting language and I realized my biggest confusion surrounding OO Ruby was overthinking EVERYTHING. When I didn't understand what I was supposed to write (coding is so much more interpretive than I realized) I would take a step back and think about it in a more obscure fashion. 

Example:
The "Initialize" method seemed so complicated and redundant at first. It still feels that way to me, but after playing with it, it makes sense now... the initialize method is useful when you want to initialize some class variables at the time of object creation.

class Box
   def initialize(w,h)
      @width, @height = w, h
   end
end

box = Box.new(10, 20)

So easy, but so confusing at first. Is this easy for people to understand right away? Am I the only one to be utterly confused and frustrated by the juxtaposition of this? Definitely not. 

Of course, this is only the beginning to the OO Ruby - adding in instance variables, accesors, setter methods...all so tedious but after A LOT of time spent getting frustrated at the simplicity, it makes sense. 

Takeaway: simplicity can be overthought. Take a step back, deep breath, try again.
